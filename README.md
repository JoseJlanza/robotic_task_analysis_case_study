### 📌 **Executive Summary**

This case study analyzes robotic task performance within an operational environment to identify inefficiencies, failure patterns, and areas for process optimization. Using SQL and Looker Studio, the analysis focused on four primary task types—Assembly, Painting, Welding, and Inspection—and evaluated their performance across time, reliability, and environmental conditions. 

Key findings reveal that Assembly consistently ranks high in both processing time and failure rate, making it a priority target for optimization. Painting showed a strong reliance on human intervention, especially under stable conditions. Environmental instability was linked to increased failure rates, most notably for Assembly, suggesting a need for improved automation resilience. The insights gathered informed actionable recommendations aimed at improving operational efficiency, reducing downtime, and enhancing reliability.

### 🎯 **Introduction**

This case study explores the operational performance of robotic tasks by analyzing sensor and task-level data. The objective is to:
- Identify time-consuming or inefficient tasks
- Uncover trends in failure and human intervention
- Evaluate the effect of environmental conditions on task performance
- Provide data-driven recommendations for optimization

Data analysis was conducted using SQL in BigQuery, with insights visualized in Looker Studio. The project followed a structured analytical approach covering six phases: Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, and Act. This report highlights the key insights and recommended strategies for improving robotic task performance based on the analyzed data.
