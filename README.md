# robotic_task_analysis_case_study
insights from an analysis of robotic task performance across four categories: Assembly, Painting, Welding, and Inspection. Using SQL and BigQuery, I evaluated task efficiency, failure rates, and environmental impact. The goal: identify inefficiencies, understand failure patterns, and recommend strategies for optimizing robotic operations.
