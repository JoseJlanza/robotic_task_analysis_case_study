## 🔍 Key Insights from Robotic Operations Analysis

### 🛠️ Task Efficiency
- **Painting** and **Assembly** have the highest average processing times (~61s and ~60s respectively).
- **Assembly** contributes the most to total processing time overall, making it the most time-intensive task.
- These task types present the greatest opportunity for reducing cumulative operational delays.

### ⚠️ Task Reliability
- **Assembly** has the highest failure rate (~58%) and human intervention rate (~54%), indicating potential design or automation issues.
- **Painting** also shows a high intervention rate, pointing to a reliance on manual processes despite moderate failure rates.
- The margin between task types in failure rate is not extreme, but Assembly consistently leads in risk.

### 🌍 Environmental Impact
- **Assembly’s failure rate increases sharply under unstable environmental conditions**, while its processing time remains consistent.
- **Painting** shows a noticeable drop in human intervention under unstable conditions, suggesting manual processes are less involved in these scenarios.
- **Inspection** demonstrates unusual behavior with its highest failure rate occurring under stable conditions, warranting further investigation.

### 💡 Optimization Opportunity
- **Assembly** is a recurring outlier across time, failure, and intervention dimensions — making it the strongest candidate for targeted process improvements.
- **Process reliability** and **environmental robustness** should be prioritized for Assembly and Inspection tasks.
- **Automation enhancements** may reduce manual workload for Painting, especially in stable settings.
