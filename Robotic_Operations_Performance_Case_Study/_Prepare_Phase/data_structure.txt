Column Name							Description & Relevance
Robot_ID					Identifies individual robots; useful for tracking performance per robot.
Task_Type					Defines the type of task performed, allowing categorization of efficiency and errors.
Processing_Time_s_				Represents task duration (critical for efficiency analysis).
Accuracy_%_					Indicates performance quality (potential correlation with failure rates).
Environmental_Status				May impact performance (e.g., temperature, humidity affecting failures).
Energy_Consumption_kWh_	Measures		 efficiency per task (optional for deeper insights).
Human_Intervention_Needed			Indicates whether a robot required human assistance (failure indicator).
Obstacle_Detected				Could contribute to task delays and failures.
Defect_Detected	Key indicator for failure analysis.
