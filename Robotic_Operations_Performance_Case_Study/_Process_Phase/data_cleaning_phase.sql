---Query to identify key columns--
-- Determine which columns are relevant for our analysis. Based on our objectives, weâ€™re looking for: Task duration: measures efficiency. Error logs: Indicicates failure rates. Task type: Help catogorize. Timestamp: Enables trend analysis. Robot ID: Allows us to analyze per-machine perfomance.--
